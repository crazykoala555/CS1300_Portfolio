        <p>My chosen interface is the control system for an oven and stove top appliance.
            There are three main components to the interface illustrated above.
            The four knobs surround the center, for controlling the stove top burners.
            The center console relates to controlling the oven, as well as time-related functions.
            The center digitizer displays time, as well as any time and oven-related information,
            like temperature and timer. Each button, if applicable, is grouped with other buttons
            based on function. The interface in general tries to provide a set of controls to control
            the main functions of the appliance, that being cooking in the oven or using the stovetops.

        <h2>Research Observations and Interview Summaries</h2>
        <p>During the research process, I was able to observe and interview three
        different users which used the interface. Between each user there were definitely similarities
        and differences in processes as each one used the kitchen appliance. Here are my observations:</p>
        <div class="indObservation">
            <h2>General Observations:</h2>
            <b>Common patterns for oven use:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Press "On Button"</li>
                <li>Select type of use (Broil/Bake)</li>
                <li>Once temperature appears on digital display, use +/- buttons to control desired temperature.</li>
                <li>If timer is needed:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Press "time" button, set timer using up/down buttons.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Cook!</li>
                <li>Press off button when done.</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Common patterns for stove top use:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Determine which stove top to use first, find respective knob.</li>
                <li>Push in corresponding knob, twist to "LO" direction to start.</li>
                <li>Ensure "Burner On" light is lit.</li>
                <li>Cook!</li>
                <li>Turn knob to off position when done, ensure "Burner On" light turns off.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Most users seemed fairly confident when using the stove top interface, but when
            tasked with operating the oven, showed a bit of confusion to which button corresponded to what, and
            in what exact order things needed to be pressed. One common thing is that each user only ever used one
            of the functions of the appliance at a time, either the oven or the stove top, not both. Notably, user 1, when using the
            stove, first tried to turn the knob to "HI" first, compared to user 3, who turned the knob to "LO" first. Users 2
            and 3, when setting the timer for cook time, both overshot their expected time and had to use the "-" button
            in order to return to their desired cook time. What I found interesting was that those who used the stove top
            burners didn't get confused about needing to push knob in, there are no indicators saying that is needed. Most
            likely known from previous experience.</p>

        </div>

        <p>During interviews, I had three main questions for each user:</p>

        <ol id="questionList">
            <li>What item first draws your attention when looking at the system controls?</li>
            <li>What would you do to turn on the front left stove-top burner?</li>
            <li>What would you do to turn on the oven?</li>
            <li>Is there anything that you find frustrating or nice about this interface?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Here is a compiled list of answers to these questions:</p>
        <div id="individualObsContainer">


            <div class="indObservation">
                <h2>Interview Question Observations:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Users note the simplistic nature of the stove controls, but also acknowledge the more complicated
                        stove controls. Users note uncertainty about some oven settings and timer controls.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Users note the first thing noticed is generally the digital display, which lights up and draws the
                        most attention, as well as providing useful information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some users note how the interface is in general a bit slow, and that if in a rush, can overshoot
                        input of temperatures/times, needing to go back and fix it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Users note helpfulness of burner diagrams and settings indicator lights as tools to assist use of
                        appliance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Interestingly, one user even noted the oven controls to be too complicated, and instead using the
                        simpler, nearby toaster oven instead.
                    </li>
                </ul>

        <h2>Generating Empathy Maps from Observations and Interviews</h2>
        <p>After observations and interviews with a set of users, I generated a set of empathy maps for two varying types of personas.
            Each persona provides a different set of attributes based on the types of users that may use this interface. I noticed two types of
            people who may use this appliance: those who are cooking just to eat, and would rather be doing something else, and those
            who enjoy the process of cooking more, and will spend more time doing it. See the below empathy maps:

                    <p>
                        &emsp; User 1 is a person who is not super interested in the process of cooking, and kind of just wants the
                        food to be done as quickly as possible. <br>
                        &emsp; By trying to speed through everything so that they are able to go onto the next task, user 1 pays a bit
                        less attention to instructions, and prioritizes speed over everything else. They regularly overshoot numbers
                        when trying to dial in settings, and have to go back to fix it. They are fairly impatient and don't want to
                        spend time looking up how to use the appliance, sometimes making mistakes and pressing the wrong buttons, getting
                        frustrated with the appliance. <br>
                        &emsp; This persona is very similar to those who don't really enjoy cooking, and simply do it because they need sustenance.
                        They, therefore want to cook for the shortest time possible, taking shortcuts, making mistakes, and being impatient.
                        In observations, you can see how this user appears, noting how some stuff is too complex, and would rather use the
                        simpler toaster oven instead. There are also notes of how users typically thing the interface is too slow when inputting information.

                        &emsp; User 2 is a person who enjoys the process of cooking, and notably, takes their time when operating
                        the appliance interface. <br>
                        &emsp; By taking their time with everything and enjoying the process of cooking, user 2 pays more attention
                        to the appliance controls, and refers to their phone if they get confused. Ah, the wonders of the internet!
                        While the controls seem a bit confusing when operating the oven, and they don't really understand how the other
                        timer functions work, they stick with what they know and remain calm. <br>
                        &emsp; This persona is very similar to those who do enjoy cooking, as those who enjoy are more likely to take their time
                        and enjoy the process, remaining calm and extremely patient while their food cooks. By remaining calm, they're able
                        to take their time working with the inputs of the system, and even if confusing, turning to the internet to correctly
                        using the appliance.

        <h2>Generating a Storyboard from a Persona</h2>
        <p>Using persona 1, the "Busy Bee", I generated a general interaction that the user might have with the interface.
        details the story of a person who is under a time crunch, and wants to cook something as quickly as possible. It details
        how he messes around with the interface in a haphazard manner in the name of speed, all to make a bowl of overcooked ramen.</p>
        <div id="storyboardContainer">
            <div class="individualStoryPanel">

                    Our protagonist, Jeff, arrives home after a long day, needing simply some nutrition so
                    he can go to soccer practice at 4:10p.m.
                </p>
            </div>

                <p>
                    Jeff forages quickly through the cabinet in the kitchen to find ramen, something extremely
                    easy and quick to cook, which he takes out to eat.
                </p>
            </div>

                <p>
                    Jeff prepares the ramen, noting the time he has remaining before he has to leave for
                    soccer practice.
                </p>
            </div>

                <p>
                    Wanting to save as much time as possible, Jeff turns on the stove to maximum, pressing in
                    the corresponding knob for the burner he wants to use, and turns it anticlockwise to the maximum temperature.
                    He checks his phone in the meantime to ensure he's doing it correctly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once the water begins boiling, Jeff inserts his ramen and seasoning in. In a hope to speed up
                    the cooking process, he keeps the water boiling at maximum temperature.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Jeff hurriedly inputs the time into the timer, overshooting the time
                    by a little, and having to backtrack 2 minutes. Unsure whether or not the timer is working, he decides to
                    press the time button again to see if it'll confirm the number. Luckily, it does.

                <p>
                    Once the timer runs out, the appliance beeps, signifying the finish of the ramen. In a speedy manner, Jeff
                    turns off the stove. Once the burner light is off, he removes the pan from the stove, noting how he still
                    has time left to eat on the digital display, a helpful feature.

                <p>
                    Having kept the water boiling, the noodles are quite a bit overcooked and very hot,
                    but Jeff enjoys his noodles anyway. Use of kitchen appliance accomplished!
